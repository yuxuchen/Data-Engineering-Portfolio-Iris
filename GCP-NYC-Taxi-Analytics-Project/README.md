# GCP-NYC-Yellow-Taxi-Analytics-Project
## Introduction
This project leverages Google Cloud Platform (GCP) to process and analyze data efficiently. It focuses on analyzing 2024 New York Yellow Taxi data stored in Google Cloud Storage (GCS), while Google Compute Engine (GCE) virtual machines facilitate ETL processes using Mage. A structured data warehouse is designed based on data characteristics, utilizing BigQuery for analysis and generating analytical tables. Interactive and insightful reports are then created using Looker, enabling data-driven decision-making.
